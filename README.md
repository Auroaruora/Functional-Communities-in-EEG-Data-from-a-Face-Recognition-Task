# Functional-Communities-in-EEG-Data-from-a-Face-Recognition-Task
This study analyzes EEG data from a face recognition task to identify functional brain communities across conditions (famous, non-famous, scrambled faces). Using Alpha and Beta bands, dWPLI measures phase synchronization, and the Louvain algorithm detects seven stable communities, highlighting patterns of coordinated brain activity.
